## Apple Muesli

1 tart apple, grated

1 cup oats

1/2 cup coconut

1/2 cup chopped nuts

1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon salt

4 chopped dates

1 cup blueberries or other fresh fruit

Yogurt, for serving

Add oats, dates, nuts, coconut, cinnamon, and salt to food processor.  Pulse a few times, then stir the apples and blueberries in.  Serve a scoop of the muesli over plain yogurt for breakfast.  If you like a sweeter breakfast, the muesli is lovely with a couple tablespoons of fruit or maple syrup swirled in with the fruit.
