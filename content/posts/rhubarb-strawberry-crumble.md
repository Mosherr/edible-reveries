*Rhubarb Strawberry Crumble*

I don’t think I’ve mentioned it on here yet, but I get a biweekly CSA box delivered to my home. CSA boxes definitely
aren’t for everyone (I used to waste a shameful amount of produce when I was younger and received one) but they are
great for my cooking now. I end up with produce I never would have bought otherwise.

Rhubarb is in that category, but I’m really not sure why. I like rhubarb, I grew up eating wonderful strawberry rhubarb
pies that my mother and grandmother made. My sister is crazy for the stuff. It definitely has a presence in my life --
but not on my shopping list. I have never, ever gone out of my way to buy rhubarb. I’ve just ended up with it, either as
a gift or in my CSA box. And thank goodness for that!

Rhubarb is a very tart fruit, and so it is often paired with sweeter fruits like strawberries. In this crumble I’ve done
that, but I flipped around the ratios to have more rhubarb than strawberry. I’m not being a maverick baker -- I just
have more rhubarb than I do strawberries in my CSA box.

This isn’t a strawberry rhubarb crumble -- this is a Rhubarb Strawberry Crumble. And don’t you forget it.

## Rhubarb Strawberry Crumble

adapted from [Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2007/05/crumbling-crisp-convictions/)

TOPPING INGREDIENTS

¾ cup white flour

¼ cup whole wheat flour

⅓ cup dry oats

1 teaspoon baking powder

3 tablespoons brown sugar

Zest from 1 lemon (for goodness sakes, zest the lemon before juicing it -- don’t be like me!)

7 tablespoons melted coconut oil

Pinch of salt

FILLING INGREDIENTS

2 cups sliced rhubarb

1 pint strawberries, halved or quartered

Juice from ½ lemon

½ cup sugar

3 tablespoons cornstarch

Pinch of salt

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Mix together all of your topping ingredients until different sized clumps form. Set
aside.

Toss all of the filling ingredients together directly in a 9 inch deep dish pie pan or 8x8 square dish. Cover the fruit
mixture evenly with the topping. Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and place the baking dish on it (the
lining is in case the fruit bubbles over). Put it all in the oven for 40-50 minutes, or until the crumble is golden
brown and you can see the fruit bubbling.
