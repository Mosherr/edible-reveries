*Orange nog ingredients*

There is a cookbook in my mother’s home that she received as a wedding gift in 1970,The Culinary Arts Institute
Encyclopedic Cookbook. She’s been using it all these years, and I’ve been cooking from it since I was about 6. It is
stained, torn, floury and all together well loved. This is my baking bible - it’s measurements are exact and classic.
But outside of the baked goods sections, some of these recipes are weird and from another era!

I never really ventured outside of the baking section until I bought my own used copy on Amazon. My copy is even older
than my mother’s, from 1950. I can’t say I’m willing to try recipes like Gherkins in Dried Beef Rolls or Molded Cheese
Salad, but when I started wandering through the drink recipes I saw something that sounded delicious called Orange Nog.
The only nog I have ever known about is egg nog, and I keep that down to one glass a year at the holidays, plus maybe
some fancy french toast to finish the carton. What would orange nog be like, I wondered?

*Culinary Arts Institute Encyclopedic Cookbook -- why is this perfect homemaker cross-eyed?*

Orange nog is essentially just lightly sweetened milk shaken over ice with orange juice. So simple and lovely I wonder
why I never thought of it myself, I picture serving frosty glasses of this nog to my future children. Their cherubic
faces smile up at me and chirp, “Thank you Mama!” They seem to have perfect Downton Abbey English accents and are all
wearing newsie caps. Mary Poppins music is playing in the background. My fingernails are perfectly manicured and I think
I’m effortlessly walking in heels!

...Or maybe I’ll just make the nog to make myself drink milk.

straining and leaving the ice behind. Serves one happy camper who is getting her calcium for once!
