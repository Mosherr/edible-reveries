I’m sure I’m not the only one here who spends a good deal of time reading food blogs. My normal M.O. is to surf through
a lot of recipes from different sources and then adjust them for my own tastes. I never seem to be able to leave well
enough alone! There is only one blog that I trust to give me recipes that I’m going to love every time -- that blog is
[Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/).

[Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/) was the first food blog I became a regular reader of, and it has inspired me as a home cook over the
years many times. Deb’s humorous, self-deprecating words make me smile as my tummy rumbles in response to her recipe of
the week. Also -- in every post there is a picture of her adorable son. Who can say no to cute toddlers and delicious
food? Not me.

Deb’s style of cooking is also one I’ve adopted for myself -- the idea of good, unfussy food. To be quite honest, I’m
incredibly lazy and will skip steps in recipes to make it easier on myself. Deb’s recipes are already streamlined and
often don’t require me to make extra trips to the grocery store. She is a home cook just like a lot of us - she works
with what she has without sacrificing the flavor.

[Smitten Kitchen](http://smittenkitchen.com/) was also recently released as a cookbook and it is beautiful! I kept it on my bedside table for about 2
weeks as I flipped through it every night before going to bed. It's a well balanced cookbook that provides just as much
useful information and inspiration as it does food porn. I dare you to read it without drooling over the cover photos
alone!  I’ve only made one recipe from it so far - the apple cider caramels. They were luscious ... but that’s a story
for another time.
