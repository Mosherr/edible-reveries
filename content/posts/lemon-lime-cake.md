On the heels of last week’s delicious disaster, here is the recipe for Lemon Lime Layer Cake with Lemon Whipped Cream
Frosting and Raspberry Filling. This cake is springy (texturally speaking, but it also suits the warm weather) and
flavorful - the lemon makes it taste lighter than all that whipped cream should make you feel. Raspberry is meant to be
paired with lemon!  I served this alongside fresh strawberries and ended up dipping the berries in the whipped cream (
another match made in heaven!)  If you are fancier than me, try decorating the cake with fresh berries on top of the
cream.

The recipe is adapted from Cooking Light, who gave me the idea of using frozen juice concentrates as flavoring agents. I
liked how it turned out. You could probably substitute fresh lemon juice, but would need to increase the sugar in the
cake to compensate. Or just buy the concentrate and use the rest in cocktails!

One note on using whipped cream frosting -- this stuff is good. Frosting is a controversial topic, but everyone likes
flavored whipped cream. In my opinion it’s really the best and easiest way to frost a cake, but in this simple form it
doesn’t last long because it isn’t stabilized. So, if you want to use this for a cake, make it on the day of serving or
the day before serving. And make sure to refrigerate!  Alternately, the internet is a goldmine that can tell you how to
stabilize whipped cream for frosting (I just haven’t tried and can’t recommend a technique).

## Lemon Lime Layer Cake

adapted from [Cooking Light](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/lemonade-layer-cake-10000000249959/#)

INGREDIENTS

1 cup white sugar

6 tablespoons softened butter, plus extra for greasing pans

Zest from 1 lime (or lemon)

4 tablespoons of thawed lemonade concentrate

2 teaspoons vanilla

2 eggs

2 egg whites

2 cups flour, plus extra for flouring pans

1 tablespoon baking powder

1/2 tablespoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 1/4 cups buttermilk (fat free or low fat is fine)

1/2 cup raspberry jam (for filling)

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Butter and lightly flour 2 round cake pans.

Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl. Cream together the first 5
ingredients (through vanilla) for 5 minutes with an electric mixer. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each
addition. Do the same with the egg whites. Add the flour mixture and the buttermilk a little at a time, alternating
additions and beating well each time. You should begin and end with the flour.

Pour the batter into the prepared pans - tap them sharply on the counter once to get rid of any air bubbles. Bake them
in the preheated oven for 20 minutes (to check if cake is done, stick a toothpick in the middle - if it comes out clean,
it’s done!)  Cool in pans for 10 minutes and then flip them out of the pans to cool on wire racks. Once they are
completely cooled, spread the jam on top of one cake round; top it with the other. Frost the rest of the cake with the
whipped cream frosting.
