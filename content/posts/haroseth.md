Dried Fruit Haroseth

Last week wasn’t just Persian New Year, it was also the beginning of Passover. Since Daniel is Jewish, I wanted to mark
the occasion somehow. I almost always mark occasions with food!  This year I tried my hand at making haroseth, a spiced
fruit and nut concoction that was completely new to me and will henceforth be in my refrigerator often!

This recipe is so easy it’s embarrassing. You really just chop a bunch of dried fruit up (and to be honest, you can use
whatever dried fruit you like) and mix it with some flavorful juice and spices. That’s it. I am told the traditional way
to serve haroseth is on matzo at your Passover seder. However, I had two other favorite ways of serving it that were by
no means traditional. One: early in the morning when no one is looking, take that matzo, crumble some feta on it and
scoop up the haroseth. Salty and sweet were meant to be!. Two: try it on your breakfast yogurt -- it was a revelation as
a condiment.

My last non-traditional secret -- next time I'm trying this with coconut!

## DRIED FRUIT HAROSETH

adapted from [Bon Appetit](http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/2011/04/pistachio_and_dried_fruit_haroseth)

INGREDIENTS

1 1/2 cups chopped pistachio meats

1/2 cup chopped pitted dates

1/2 cup dried cherries

1/2 cup chopped dried apricots

1 chopped apple

1/4 cup port wine

1/4 cup pomegranate juice

1 tablespoon honey

1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice

1 teaspoon orange zest

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg

Heat a heavy pan over medium heat and toast the pistachios until fragrant, around 4-5 minutes. Let cool while chopping
your fruit.

Combine all of the fruit with the wine and juice; drizzle in the honey, zest, spices and lemon. Let stand at least 15
minutes. If you are serving immediately, stir in the pistachios. If you are serving the next day, hold off on that until
the last minute - they get a little mushy.
