Roasted chickpeas

I am not what you would call a huge snacker, especially if I am kept entertained (I’m like a baby, I cry if you don’t
feed me and play with me at regular intervals). But if I’m bored for a long period of time, or if I have an especially
trying project at work, I tend to start feeling nibbly. Not hungry!  Just nibbly - my mouth starts to crave action and
stimulation. This is usually solved at work by delving into a coworker’s candy jar, but sweet doesn’t really do it for
me. Give me salty, give me savory - but please don’t give me chips, they make me feel gross!  What else is there around
that is salty?

These roast chickpeas are the perfect way to satisfy that nibbly, salty craving. They’re crunchy and salty and spicy.
They’re also high in fiber and low in fat, but honestly who wants to hear about that? What you want to know is that they
are delicious and easy and keep well on your desk for when the snack monster attacks.

Never leave home without your chickpeas.

spiced chickpeas

I’ve been using the Moroccan Spice Mix (adapted from [Kalyn’s Kitchen](http://www.kalynskitchen.com/2008/02/crispy-roasted-chickpeas-garbanzo-beans.html)), but these would be great with any spices you
like. I’ll give you the basic recipe for the chickpeas, and then the spices I use.

## ROASTED CHICKPEAS

INGREDIENTS

1 can chickpeas

1 tablespoon olive oil

1/2 teaspoon of desired spices

salt to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Rinse the chickpeas and then allow to drain well. Dry them in a dish towel by rubbing them
gently. This will also get rid of a lot of the chickpea skin, but don’t worry about removing them unless you’re crazy
like me -- they’re just extra fiber.

Mix the chickpeas, olive oil and spices in a bowl and spread them out on a baking sheet. Salt the chickpeas liberally
and bake them for 50-55 minutes. I like mine on the longer side because I like them super crispy - they should be nicely
browned by now. Let them cool and then pop them in your mouth repeatedly.
