*Baked Turkey Meatballs*

I will admit that change is really hard for me to deal with. I’m a creature of habit and I hate when those habits have
to be altered due to circumstances out of my control. Alright, ok, I’ll cop to that as well -- I hate it when there are
circumstances out of my control!  I’m a type-A control freak who likes to eat her breakfast at the same time every day
and sit down in the same place while doing it. I do not handle change with grace. I handle it with meatballs.

*Meatball ingredients*

Well, maybe that’s too specific. I come from a long tradition of comfort eaters who look for solace in familiar, warm
foods. This is not the time for fancy recipes with long ingredient lists. This is not the time to flirt with
vegan/gluten free baking techniques. This is a time for hearty peasant food, food that will fill your belly and make you
feel just a little safer in the world that is whirling around you at breakneck speed. Food that your mother might have
made for you when you were a child (Mommy, can I please have crunchy chicken and mashed potatoes?)

These meatballs help me feel solid, like not everything always has to change. Maybe the world is as simple now as it was
when I was a child, gobbling up my mom’s spaghetti and meatballs. All I have to do is enter my own kitchen to find that
lovely simplicity again.

*Rolling the meatballs (lightly please!)*

## Baked Turkey Meatballs

INGREDIENTS

1 ¼ lb ground turkey

½ cup bread crumbs

¼ cup grated onion

¼ cup grated parmesan

1 minced garlic clove

1 egg

3 tablespoons fresh herbs (parsley, basil, mint etc)

½ - ¾ tsp salt

pepper to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees

Combine all ingredients lightly -- if you mix with a heavy hand, your meatballs will end up dense. Mixing the meat
should be almost like a gentle fluffing. Do not overmix. Roll your meatballs into 1 inch balls and place on a lightly
greased or lined baking sheet. Bake for 25 minutes, or until they are cooked through.

These are also great freezer food!  Let them cool completely on the baking sheet, then freeze the meatballs
individually. Once they are frozen, store them in a tightly sealed bag or container. Thaw by lightly frying in a pan or
by dropping them directly into your warming sauce.
