Frittattas are such a wonderful breakfast/lunch/dinner food. They are filling but light, they taste luxuriant while
still being a little healthier than many eggy dishes. That of course depends on what you put in them. I like loading
mine up with fresh herbs and vegetables, along with a healthy (ha!) dose of cheese. Frittatas are also potentially
quick, depending on what you have on hand. Which leads me to the most important piece of information -- you can put
anything in these suckers!

Have a couple extra bites of pasta from last night? Throw it in! Some leftover roasted veggies? Get in my pan! Just a
few nubbins of a bunch of cheeses left that you want to clear out of the fridge? Why aren’t you melting into my eggs
right now?

What I’m trying to say is that frittatas are as versatile as your imagination can make them. I’ll give you the base
recipe first, and then tell you my favorite add-ins later.

I’m going to assume you’re cooking for 3 people here. If you want it for fewer or more people, either subtract or add
some eggs and milk and change up the pan size. It is a very forgiving recipe.

## BASIC FRITTATA

Ingredients

7 eggs (I always calculate 2 eggs per person and then add 1 egg for good measure)

½ cup of cream or milk

2 tablespoons of olive oil

Salt and pepper to taste

Various add-ins

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. In an oven safe medium sized skillet, warm the olive oil over a low heat. Whisk
together the eggs and milk and season them to taste. Pour the eggs in and let them cook undisturbed for 8 minutes - this
gives them time to set on the bottom. Transfer the pan to a preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes. Once the frittata is
set, slice that baby up and dig in!

That sounds tasty but it’s really just plain eggs at this point - let’s sexy it up a little! Remember - if I sautee
spinach, you can sub any vegetable. If I grate in parmesan, you can feel free to use feta if that’s what you have --
there are infinite possibilities here!

## CARAMELIZED ONION, SPINACH AND RICOTTA FRITTATA

adapted from [Joy the Baker](http://joythebaker.com/2012/10/onion-and-ricotta-frittata/#)

Ingredients

7 eggs

½ cup cream or milk

3 tablespoons olive oil

salt and pepper to taste

10 ounces fresh spinach

½ cup caramelized onions (this amount is from 2 [onions caramelized](/caremelized-onions) ahead of time - I keep this stuff stocked in my
freezer, it's like gold)

¼ cup chopped fresh dill

6 tablespoons fresh ricotta

⅓ cup grated parmesan cheese

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. In an oven safe medium sized skillet, warm 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat.
Add the spinach in batches and wilt it, along with a little salt and pepper for flavor. Once the vegetable (any
vegetable!) is cooked, remove it to a bowl and wipe out the pan. Set aside off heat. Squeeze out any leftover liquid
from the spinach before the next step.

Whisk together the eggs, grated parmesan (any cheese here, it’s to distribute flavor throughout the frittata), dill (or
any fresh herb), milk and salt and pepper to taste. Warm the oven safe skillet over low heat with the remaining 2
tablespoons of olive oil. Distribute the caramelized onions evenly in the pan, and do the same with the spinach. Pour
the eggs over the vegetables and cook over low heat for 8 minutes. Once the eggs are set, dollop 6 tablespoons of
ricotta around the edges of the frittata (this looks so pretty, and provides 1 dollop per slice). Transfer the pan to
the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes. After it bakes, slice it up and enjoy a deep feeling of accomplishment as
you bring joy to others.

See? You can add any combination of vegetables and cheese to these. The important thing is to have everything slightly
warmed before adding the eggs in - this holds true if you’re adding leftover pasta as well.

Enjoy!
