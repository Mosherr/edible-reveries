## Sticky Ginger Tofu

Adapted from [Dinner: A Love Story](http://www.dinneralovestory.com/tofu-multiple-choice/)

1 block extra firm tofu

2 teaspoons sesame oil

1/2 cup soy sauce

1/2 cup water

1/2 - 1 teaspoon grated ginger

1 large clove grated garlic

3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar

1/3 cup brown sugar

1/2 teaspoon sriracha (or to taste)

2 tablespoons cornstarch

2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil

3 green onions

1 lime

Slice the tofu in half and wrap in clean, lint-free dish towels.  Weigh it down with heavy pans, wine bottles, etc.  Let drain for 30 minutes.  While tofu drains, make the sauce.  Mix sauce ingredients (sesame oil through brown sugar) and set aside.  Slice green onions and quarter limes.

Unwrap drained tofu and cut into large cubes.  Toss cubes with cornstarch to coat.  Heat up oil in nonstick skillet on medium high heat.  Sear both sides of tofu until browned, then pour sauce over tofu in skillet.  Let it simmer for 5-10 minutes until thickened.  Garnish tofu with green onions and squeezes of lime.  I like serving this over brown rice and roasted green beans or broccoli.
