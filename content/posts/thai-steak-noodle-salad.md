## Thai Steak and Noodle Salad

Adapted from Smitten Kitchen

Sauce and Marinade:

1/4 cup brown sugar

4 tablespoons fish sauce

1/3 cup lime juice

3 cloves minced garlic

1 teaspoon sriracha

Salad:

1 pound flat iron steak (flank steak works nicely too)

3 tablespoons avocado oil (or vegetable oil)

8 ounce package thin rice noodles

1 pound green beans (I like the package of haricot vert they sell at Trader Joe's)

8 ounces halved cherry tomatoes

4 thinly sliced Persian cucumbers

1/2 cup cleaned chopped herbs (cilantro and mint)

Whisk together sauce ingredients, minus the oil.  Marinate steak in 1/3 of the sauce, a freezer bag makes this very easy, for at least an hour but no more than a day.    Whisk oil into remaining sauce to create the salad dressing.

Blanch green beans in salted boiling water for approximately 2 minutes, then plunge into a bowl of ice water.  Drain and dry.  Use the same water to cook noodles according to package directions.  Set aside -- if noodles are sticky, you can rinse with cold water or stir in some oil.

Remove steak from marinade and grill on high heat to your desired doneness.  After resting the meat, thinly slice it for the salads.  Pile everything on top of a bed of noodles and spoon dressing over the top.
