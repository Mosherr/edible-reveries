Welcome to Edible Reveries! Here you’ll find my thoughts, opinions and ravings about food and food-related topics.
Sometimes I’ll give you my favorite recipes too.

Edible Reveries is a food interest blog written by Amineh, a lazy home cook with too much time on her hands who never
seems to have enough time to do anything. When not cooking or thinking about food, her favorite things to do are watch
reruns of Doctor Who and convince her partner, Daniel, to pay even more attention to her.
